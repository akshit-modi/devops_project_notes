Step-1: Create repo in GitHub and intitalize readme file.

Step-2: Here we create total 3 Jobs in Jenkins and every job is assigned a task that they completed automatically, we just need to set up that.

Step-3: 

Job-1:

In this Step, we configure our first job for master branch of GitHub

--> Job is get data(every minute) from GitHub and copy it in one folder.

-->launch docker image from job and mount it with this folder and expose it so outside world can connect to it.

-->This will work as a production OS.


Step-4:
Job-2:

In this Step, we configure our first job for another branch of GitHub(In our case dev2)

--> Job is get data(every minute) from GitHub and copy it in one folder.

-->launch docker image from job and mount it with this folder and expose it so outside world can connect to it.

-->This will work as a Testing OS.


Step-5:

Job-3:

In this step, we merge data of dev2 branch with master branch when our QAT(Quality Assurance Team) certify our testing os is working fine.

-->Merge dev2 with master branch and all aditional facilities of dev2 branch added to our production OS.

-->Now, your complete setup is automatic.
